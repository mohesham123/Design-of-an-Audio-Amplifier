Amplifier and Common Emitter Amplifier
Overview
An Amplifier is an electronic circuit designed to increase the strength of a weak input signal in terms of voltage, current, or power. This process is called Amplification.

Key Amplification Constraint
The magnitude of the signal increases without altering its original shape.
Transistor as an Amplifier
Configuration Selection: Choose the appropriate configuration for the desired operation.
Biasing: Set the transistor's operating point (Q-point) correctly.
Signal Application: Apply the input signal and achieve output gain.
Common Emitter Amplifier
The Common Emitter Amplifier is a single-stage bipolar junction transistor (BJT) circuit primarily used as a voltage amplifier.

Terminals
Input: Connected to the Base terminal.
Output: Taken from the Collector terminal.
Common Terminal: Emitter terminal is shared between input and output.
Circuit Components
Resistors
R1: Used for forward biasing.
R2: Helps develop the bias voltage.
RL (Load Resistor): Located at the output.
RE (Emitter Resistor): Provides thermal stability.
Capacitors
C1 (Input Capacitor):
Couples the AC signal to the base terminal of the BJT.
Blocks DC voltage from the signal source.
CE (Emitter Bypass Capacitor):
Provides a low reactance path for the amplified AC signal.
Prevents output voltage drops caused by the amplified AC signal.
C2 (Coupling Capacitor):
Couples the output of one amplification stage to the next.
Isolates DC bias settings between stages.
Detailed Component Functions
Biasing Circuit / Voltage Divider
Components: R1, R2, RE
Purpose:
Establishes a proper operating Q-point for the transistor.
Prevents clipping of the negative half-cycle of the signal.
Input Capacitor (C1)
Purpose:
Couples the signal to the base terminal.
Isolates the signal source from R2 to maintain the bias voltage.
Function:
Allows only AC signals to pass.
Emitter Bypass Capacitor (CE)
Purpose:
Provides a low reactance path for AC signals.
Importance:
Without it, a voltage drop occurs across RE, reducing the output signal voltage.
Coupling Capacitor (C2)
Purpose:
Transfers the output signal from one stage to another while isolating their DC components.
Summary
The Common Emitter Amplifier is a foundational electronic circuit in amplification systems. Proper design and component selection, including biasing resistors and coupling capacitors, ensure efficient signal amplification without distortion.
